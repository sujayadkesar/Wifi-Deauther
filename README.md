The ESP8266 Deauther is **a popular open-source pen-testing tool**. You can test your own WiFi network against the common denial-of-service vulnerability called deauthentication attack.


WiFi Deauther in a nutshell can kick devices off a network irrespective of whether you are connected to it or not. This is not classed as a WiFi Jammer. Using your Deauther, simply scan for nearby networks, select the network or individual clients you wish to kick off, then hit the Deauth button!
